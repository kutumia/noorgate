# 🌙 NoorGate – The Last Gate You’ll Ever Need

**NoorGate** is a minimalist, faith-aligned, one-time-use PWA that helps you protect yourself and your loved ones by permanently blocking haram content through DNS filtering — without storing any user data or requiring repeated use.

## 🛡️ What is NoorGate?

> "Close the Gate. Choose the Light."

NoorGate is a **spiritual-tech commitment device**. It's not just another parental control or monitoring tool — it's a simple, powerful setup flow that helps you:

- 🌐 Apply lifelong DNS protection (using Kahf Guard or CleanBrowsing)
- 🔐 Lock your router settings or save access with trusted contact
- 🌙 Integrate your intention with Quranic reflection and digital discipline
- ✅ Use once, and delete it — the protection remains

No accounts. No analytics. No turning back.
